Django Database Backup
======================

This Django application provides management commands to help backup and
restore your project database and media files with various storages such as
Amazon S3, DropBox or local file system.

It is made to:

- Allow you to secure your backup with GPG signature and encryption
- Archive with compression
- Deal easily with remote archiving
- Keep your development database up to date
- Use Crontab or Celery to setup automated backups

.. warning::

    Django DBBackup version 3 is very different to its predecessors.
    See `Upgrade documentation`_ to help to get up to date.

upgrading, Django-DBBackup supports PyPy, 3.2 to 3.5 and Django
greater than 3.2.
