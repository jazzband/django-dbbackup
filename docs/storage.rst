Storage settings
================

One of the most helpful feature of django-dbbackup is the avaibility to store
and retrieve backups from a local or remote storage. This functionality is
mainly based on Django Storage API and extend its possibilities.

You can choose your backup storage backend by set ``settings.DBBACKUP_STORAGE``,
it must be a full path of a storage class. For example:
``django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage`` for use file system storage.
Below, we'll list some of the available solutions and their options.

Storage's option are gathered in ``settings.DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS`` which
is a dictionary of keywords representing how to configure it.

.. warning::

    Do not configure backup storage with the same configuration than your media
    files, you'll risk to share backups inside public directories.

DBBackup uses by default the `built-in file system storage`_ to manage files on
a local directory. Feel free to use any Django storage, you can find a variety
of them at `Django Packages`_.

.. _`built-in file system storage`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/files/storage/#the-filesystemstorage-class
.. _`Django Packages`: https://djangopackages.org/grids/g/storage-backends/

.. note::

    Storing backups to local disk may also be useful for Dropbox if you
    already have the offical Dropbox client installed on your system.
